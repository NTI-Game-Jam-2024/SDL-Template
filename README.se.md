### About the Template

The SDL-Template is an exemplary starting point for projects leveraging the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library. Designed specifically for game development and multimedia applications, it offers a seamless setup process and a logically structured project framework.

### Repository Structure

- **src/**: Contains the main source files for your SDL application, organized efficiently.
- **lib/**: Stores SDL libraries and additional project dependencies.
- **assets/**: Folders categorically organized for graphics, audio, and other media.
- **config/**: Configuration files for setting parameters and options in your SDL application.
- **bin/**: Holds compiled or executable files; outputs such as .exe files are found here after building.
- **build/**: Used for files generated during the build process, including intermediate compilation files.
- **data/**: Includes game-used data files like level designs, game configuration data, or scripts.
- **docs/**: For all project documentation, encompassing Game Design Documents, developer guides, and other resources.
- **tests/**: Contains all test cases, including unit and integration tests.
- **tools/**: Various scripts or tools for building, deploying, or automating the project.
